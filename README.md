# Dotfiles


## Prerequisites
Dotfiles are enabled /disabled using GNU Stow `gnu stow`.

Install GNU Stow:
```
nix-env -i stow
```

## Checkout the project

```
cd ~
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ajevans85/.dotfiles.git
```

## Enable required configs

Enter the project directory.

```
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

For each configuration that you want to enable use `stow`. IE:

```
stow emacs
stow git
stow nix
```

Stow will create the correct symlinks in your home directory.

# SSH Config
`~/.ssh/config` is automaticaly generated by aggregating configurations under `~/.ssh/conf.d`.

An `ssh` alias has been created to automaticaly generate the config each time you run `ssh`. Also a `sshconfig` alias has been created to generate the `~/.ssh/config` file.
